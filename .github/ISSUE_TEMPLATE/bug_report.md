### Describe the bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->
<!-- You may add more labels to the issue to help us categorize it. -->

### Context

- Hardware: *VPS bought online / Old laptop or computer / Raspberry Pi at home / Internet Cube with VPN / Other ARM board / ...*
- YunoHost version: x.x.x
- I have access to my server: *Through SSH | through the webadmin | direct access via keyboard / screen | ...*
- Are you in a special context or did you perform some particular tweaking on your YunoHost instance?: *no / yes*
  - If yes, please explain:
- Using, or trying to install package version/branch:
- If upgrading, current YunoHost version: <!-- can be found in the admin, or with `yunohost -v` -->

### To reproduce

<!---
- *If you performed a command from the CLI, the command itself is enough. For example:*
    ```sh
    sudo yunohost backup list
    ```
- *If you used the webadmin, please perform the equivalent command from the CLI first.*
- *If the error occurs in your browser, explain what you did:*
   1. *Go to '...'*
   2. *Click on '...'*
   3. *Scroll down to '...'*
   4. *See error*
-->

### Expected behavior

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. You can remove this section if the command above is enough to understand your intent. -->

### Logs

<!--
When an operation fails, YunoHost provides a simple way to share the logs.
- In the webadmin, the error message contains a link to the relevant log page. On that page, you will be able to 'Share with Yunopaste'. If you missed it, the logs of previous operations are also available under Tools > Logs.
- In command line, the command to share the logs is displayed at the end of the operation and looks like `yunohost log display [log name] --share`. If you missed it, you can find the log ID of a previous operation using `yunohost log list`.

After sharing the log, please copypaste directly the link provided by YunoHost (to help readability, no need to copypaste the entire content of the log here, just the link is enough...)

If applicable and useful, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
