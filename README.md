# Issues
This is the general issue tracker for the YunoHost project

**:warning: If you have found a security issue, refer to our [security team](https://yunohost.org/security_team).**

Please read carefully the issue template and the following guide.

Let's determine if you are on the right place:
   - If your bug relates to an app provided by YunoHost (install, update, backup, restore, change url...), we prefer that you post your issue on their own issue tracker in the [YunoHost-Apps](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps) organisation. If your app is called Example, look for the "example_ynh" repository.
   - If you were performing an action from the webadmin or the CLI and want some support, you can post about it on our forum (https://forum.yunohost.org/) or our chat room (https://yunohost.org/help).
   - If you were performing an action from the webadmin or the CLI and encountered what you think is a bug, you are on the right place! Carefully follow the issue template, for better efficiency.
   - If you want to request an app to be packaged for YunoHost, please refer to the [apps wishlist](https://yunohost.org/apps_wishlist). You can [add it](https://github.com/yunohost/doc/blob/master/pages/02.applications/04.wishlist/apps_wishlist.md) if it is not already listed.
   - If you are requesting a feature for YunoHost, you are on the right place! Use the dedicated template and be as precise as possible in your description of the feature.
   - When in doubt, post here and we will figure it out together.
